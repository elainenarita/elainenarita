### Hi there 👋

My name is Elaine Narita, I am a techno geek based in São Paulo, BR. I'm a Front-end Developer, with a background in Graphic Design.
I love innovation and on my all projects I do care about all the elements that make up the interface together, including layout, visual design, user experience, text and interaction.
And I'll use that space to share my learning journey. ⚡😄
