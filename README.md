### Hi there!! 👋🏼

Let's introduce myself... 

• My name is Elaine Narita, I am a techno geek based in São Paulo, BR. 👩🏻‍💻 <br>
• I'm currently working as a Front-end Developer and I have a background in Graphic Design. 💜 <br>
• I love innovation and on my all projects I do care about all the elements that make up the interface together, including layout, visual design, user experience, text and interaction. <br>
• I'm focusing on my studies and I'll use that space to share my learning journey. 📚✨ <br><br>
