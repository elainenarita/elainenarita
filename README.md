Here are some ideas to get you started:

My name is Elaine Narita, I am a techno geek based in SÃ£o Paulo, BR. I'm a Front-end Developer, with a background in Graphic Design.
I love innovation and on my all projects I do care about all the elements that make up the interface together, including layout, visual design, user experience, text and interaction.
And I'll use that space to share my learning journey. âš¡ğŸ˜„
